# debian-scripts

I've found myself managing a debian server again.  Writing scripts
specific to debian and leaving them here for your enjoyment.

# Background

As an ops that's used to running stuff in the cloud, I'm normally not
running "pet servers." Recently, I've been practicing some Linux server
administration and this repo is the result of that.
